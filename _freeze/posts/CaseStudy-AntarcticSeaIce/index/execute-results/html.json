The ice area will probably deplete over the years due to global warming or depending on the climate during that year.\n\n### Questions based on the graph\n\nWhat is the overall trend in Antarctic ice area over the years?\n\nWhat are the typical ranges of ice area for each month?\n\nAre there any significant outliers or unusual events in the ice area data, particularly in 2023?\n\n### Questions\n\n-   Identify the type of charts - Box Plot\n\n-   Identify the variables used for various geometrical aspects (x, y, fill…). Name the variables appropriately - x-month, y- Ice Extent in million sqkm, fill- year\n\n-   What research activity might have been carried out to obtain the data graphed here? Provide some details\n\n    They likely collected data on the Antarctic ice area over the years 1990-2023 and monitored how it was affected by climate, season, etc.\n\n-   What might the red points represent?\n\n    The red points represent the year 2023. In most cases, it is an outlier except in December where it is found within the boundries of the box\n\n-   What is perhaps a befuddling aspect of this graph until you…Ohhh!!!!!!\n\n## Gender at the Workplace\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngender <-read_delim(\"../../data/job_gender_data.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 32 Columns: 12\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \";\"\nchr (3): occupation, major_category, minor_category\ndbl (7): year, total_workers, workers_male, workers_female, total_earnings, ...\nnum (2): percent_female, wage_percent_of_male\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngender\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 32 × 12\n    year occupation     major_category minor_category total_workers workers_male\n   <dbl> <chr>          <chr>          <chr>                  <dbl>        <dbl>\n 1  2016 Dietitians an… Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…         70729         8095\n 2  2016 Medical recor… Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…        148302        14938\n 3  2016 Pharmacists    Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…        214665        97539\n 4  2016 Licensed prac… Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…        602316        77484\n 5  2016 Miscellaneous… Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…        107797        25250\n 6  2016 Clinical labo… Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…        245278        68887\n 7  2016 Registered nu… Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…       2317493       281048\n 8  2016 Nurse practit… Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…        116166        14128\n 9  2016 Physician ass… Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…         76018        27869\n10  2016 Health practi… Healthcare Pr… Healthcare Pr…        440607        98824\n# ℹ 22 more rows\n# ℹ 6 more variables: workers_female <dbl>, percent_female <dbl>,\n#   total_earnings <dbl>, total_earnings_male <dbl>,\n#   total_earnings_female <dbl>, wage_percent_of_male <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngender %>%\n  gf_point(total_earnings ~ percent_female, \n           size = ~ total_workers,  \n           alpha = 0.8) %>% \n  gf_lm() %>%\n  gf_labs(\n    title = \"Salaries and Gender Proportion in the Workforce\",\n    subtitle = \"Total Earnings vs Percentage of Female Workers\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation: size.\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_line was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Data Dictionary\n\n### Qualitative\n\n-   year\n\n-   occupation\n\n-   major_category\n\n-   minor_category\n\n### Quantitative\n\n-   total_workers\n\n-   workers_male\n\n-   workers_female\n\n-   percent_female\n\n-   total_earnings - total earnings of workers\n\n-   total_earnings_male\n\n-   total_earnings_female\n\n-   wage_percent_of_male\n\n## Target Variable\n\n-   percentage_of_female\n\n-   total_earnings_female\n\n-   wage_percent_of_male\n\n## Predictor variables\n\n-   year\n\n-   occupation\n\n-   major_category\n\n-   minor_category\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   total_workers\n\n-   workers_male\n\n-   workers_female\n\n-   percent_female\n\n-   total_earnings\n\n-   total_earnings_male\n\n## Research Experiment\n\nThe experiment aims to assess whether gender plays a role in determining salary or not, and to identify any trends or patterns across various occupations in terms of gender distribution and compensation.\n\n## Questions Graph seeks to answer\n\n-   Is there a correlation between the percentage of female workers in an occupation and the median salary?\n\n-   Are occupations with a higher proportion of female workers associated with lower salaries?\n\n### Questions\n\n-   What kind of chart is used in the figure?\n\n    Scatter plot\n\n-   What geometries have been used and to which variables have these geometries been mapped?\n\n    x-axis - Represents the **percentage of the workforce reported as female**\n\n    y-axis - Represents the **median salary in the occupation**\n\n    size of the bubble - Corresponds to the **total number of workers** in the occupation\n\n-   Based on this graph, do you think gender plays a role in salaries? What is the trend you see?\n\n    In general, higher percentage of females corresponds to lower salaries. Higher salaries are associated with lower percentage of female workers. In general, smaller workforces have higher salaries\n\n-   If SALARY, NO_OF_WORKERS, GENDER, OCCUPATION were available in the original dataset, what pre-processing would have been necessary to obtain this plot?\n\n    Group by occupation\n\n    Then summarize the median salary for each occupation\n\n    Calculate the percentage of female workers\n\n    The final dataset should include:\n\n    -   **Median Salary per Occupation**: For the y-axis.\n\n    -   **Percentage of Female Workers per Occupation**: For the x-axis.\n\n    -   **Total Number of Workers per Occupation**: For the size of the bubbles.\n\n## Inference\n\n-   Occupations with higher median salaries, especially those above \\$150,000, generally have a lower proportion of female workers\n\n-   Many of the large bubbles are concentrated on the right side, where female workers are high but salaries are lower\n",
