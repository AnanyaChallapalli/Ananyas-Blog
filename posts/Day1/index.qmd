## Introduction

This is a silly little piece I am writing in Arvind's class. My back is hurting but I'm learning things so that's cool.

### My First Piece of R Code

babynames - table of all babynames in the us from 1880 to 2017

babynames shift+ctrl+M filter(name=="Aditi")

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(babynames)
```

```{r}
babynames
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Ananya")
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name== "Ananya") %>% 
  gf_line(n ~ year)
```

There were no Ananyas before 1995 :(

Also, my back and stomach stopped hurting :D

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Anoushka" | name == "Anushka")
```
